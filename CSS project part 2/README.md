# Introduction to CSS

## Description

This projects show some important **CSS principles** and properties to make our page more styled and full of flexibility!
The foremost objective of this project was to give a different visualization styles to the Website which has more features, styling options, transitions...

## key topics:

### Background images

CSS allows you to add multiple background images for an element, through the background-image property.
`background: url(img_flower.jpg);`

### Z-index

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
An element can have a positive or negative stack order.
`z-index: 1;`
`z-index: -2;`

### linear gradient

CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

`#grad {background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);}`

### media queries

The **@media rule**, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.
You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
- resolution

### pseudo-elemets

A CSS **pseudo-element** is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

### pseudo-classes

A **pseudo-class** is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

- Style an element when a user mouses over it(a:hover)
- Style visited and unvisited links differently(a:visited)
- Style an element when it gets focus(input:focus)

### transform

CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

- translate()
- rotate()
- scaleX()
- scaleY()
- scale()
- skewX()
- skewY()
- skew()

### translate

The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).
